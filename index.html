        <div class="intro" id="1">
          <p>I'm an experienced project manager with a demonstrated history of working in the media and software industries. I'm skilled in e-commerce, digital media and marketing. I'm also a product management professional with a strong knowledge of agile methods like Scrum, Kanban and SAFe.
          </p>
          <p>Concerning my current role: I’m leading e-commerce projects for different accounts with various domains. My job is to setup a Shopify Plus store in detail while managing the project from kickoff to launch. The process is usually short but intense, and there are many projects going on side by side.
          </p>
          <p>Previous experience: I have developed digital services for newspapers. Mainly websites, sales funnel, online self-services and customer experience in digital channels. One of my key competences was working as a product owner. In my case this meant working with multiple stakeholders, backlogs and dev-teams simultaneously. My main goal at Keskisuomalainen was to drive digital subscriptions and improve customer engagement and loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>I have also worked as a journalist for a local newspaper and for a local radio station. My specialities were storytelling and photography but I loved working with layouts and videos too. Sometimes I miss the excitement of live broadcasting. In addition I have experience from telecom customer service.
